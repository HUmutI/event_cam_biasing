--- UMUT DV_PROCESSING BIAS TUNER NOTES ---

dv-gui c/c++ ile çalıştığından 1-2m eventte dahi bir yavaşlama olmuyor.
dv-processing python ile çalıştığından yüksek sayılı eventlerde yavaşlama oluyor.

How to reconcile in practice

    Start by choosing the minimum I<sub>pr</sub> that actually sees your low-lux scene—you want just enough base photocurrent to reliably produce events on real edges.

    Next tweak I<sub>sf</sub> up until the event-stream “loudness” (edge amplitude) is high but the high-frequency hiss is controlled.

    If you still see too much shot-noise, trim I<sub>pr</sub> back a notch. If real edges start disappearing, raise I<sub>pr</sub> again.

    Finally, use your refractory and filtering stages to clean up whatever residuals remain.
